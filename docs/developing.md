# Working on Mise

## What you need

- Flutter (stable). Built against 3.47 / Dart 3.13.
- Nothing else. PocketBase is downloaded on demand; there is no database to
  install and no cloud account to create.

## Windows

Mise-Kal is developed on Windows as well as macOS, and the harness makes the
whole test suite runnable there. What a Windows developer needs:

- **Git for Windows**, which brings Git Bash. Run everything from Git Bash, not
  PowerShell or cmd — every script in this repository is a POSIX shell script.
- **Flutter SDK**, on PATH. `flutter --version` should answer before you start.
  If you cloned the SDK but did not add it to PATH, the harness doctor will tell
  you where it found it and what to type.
- **Nothing else.** `jq` and PocketBase are fetched into `.harness/cache/` by
  `.harness/scripts/setup-tools.sh`. Neither is installed system-wide, which is
  deliberate: `jq` is not present on a stock Windows machine and there is no
  package manager guaranteed to be there either.

Check the machine before you start:

```bash
.harness/scripts/setup-tools.sh
.harness/scripts/worktree.sh doctor
```

Three Windows-specific things worth knowing, each of which cost real time to
diagnose:

**Shell scripts must stay LF.** Git's default `core.autocrlf=true` rewrites
`.sh` files to CRLF on checkout, and bash then reads `set -euo pipefail\r`,
fails to find a command named `pipefail\r`, and dies before the script's first
line. `.gitattributes` pins the line ending in the repository so this cannot
happen. If you add a shell script and it fails strangely, check its endings
first.

**Git Bash does not honour `TMPDIR` for a literal `/tmp` path.** A script
writing to `/tmp/x.json` writes to the real `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp`,
not to whatever you set `TMPDIR` to. The harness moves those paths into each
agent's own scratch directory for exactly this reason.

**`pkill -f` matches command lines as strings, not processes.** Two test runs in
different directories start PocketBase with identical relative arguments, so one
run's cleanup kills the other's server mid-suite. The harness kills by PID.

## Running it

Two terminals.

```bash
./server/scripts/dev.sh
```

First run fetches the pinned PocketBase into `server/bin/` and applies the
migrations. Its admin UI is at http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/.

```bash
cd app && flutter run -d macos
```

`-d chrome`, `-d windows` and `-d linux` work too. On first launch, point the app
at `127.0.0.1:8090`.

## Tests

Five backend suites. Each spins up a throwaway database on its own port and
tears it down; none touch your data.

```bash
for s in smoke setup kitchen payments staff; do ./server/scripts/${s}_test.sh; done
cd app && flutter test
```

## How it fits together

```
server/pb_migrations/   the schema, in version control
server/pb_hooks/        the rules that cannot live on a client
app/lib/core/           design system, printing, reporting, server hosting
app/lib/data/           models, repositories, live queries
app/lib/features/       setup, auth, pos, kds, manager
```

### Four rules the code leans on

**Money is only ever computed on the server.** The app displays totals; it never
adds them up. A client that PATCHes a forged total has it recomputed and
overwritten, and there is a test for exactly that.

**Menu names and prices are snapshotted onto order lines.** Editing tomorrow's
menu must never rewrite yesterday's bill.

**Takings are counted by when a bill closed**, not when it opened. A table seated
before a shift began and settled during it is that shift's takings.

**Ageing and status use separate colour channels.** On the kitchen display, a
ticket's border and timer say how long; dots and chips say what state. Never
merge them, or a late ticket full of cooking items becomes unreadable.

### Things that will bite you

**PocketBase hooks run in their own runtime.** A function declared at the top of
a `.pb.js` file is not defined inside the handler. Put shared code in a
`lib_*.js` and `require` it *inside* each handler.

**PocketBase zero values are truthy objects.** An empty date is a zero
`DateTime`, so `!record.get("closed_at")` never fires. Use `getString()` and
compare to `""`. A `json` field is a byte array that passes `Array.isArray` —
decode with `.string()` first.

**Filters bind client-side.** `pb.filter("x = {:v}", {...})`, not a `query` map.
The server-side API is the one that binds parameters; the Dart SDK does not.

**The macOS app is not sandboxed, deliberately.** The sandbox quarantines every
file a sandboxed app writes, and a quarantined binary cannot be executed — so
the bundled server would never start. See the comment in
`macos/Runner/Release.entitlements`.

**iOS needs two keys to reach a LAN server** over plain HTTP:
`NSAppTransportSecurity` → `NSAllowsLocalNetworking`, and
`NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`. Without either, an iPad till silently cannot
connect.

## Building a release

```bash
./installer/macos/build_dmg.sh
```

Stages the server into the app, builds release, and produces
`installer/out/Mise-<version>-macos.dmg`. Set `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` to sign it;
without that it is unsigned and users open it from the right-click menu once.

## Changing the schema

Add a migration to `server/pb_migrations/` — never edit an applied one. Then run
the suites; `smoke` and `payments` cover most of what schema changes break.
